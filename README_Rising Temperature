SQL Query: Find Dates with Higher Temperatures than the Previous Day
 Problem Statement

Given a table `Weather` that contains daily temperature records, write a SQL query to find the `id`s of all dates where the temperature was higher than the previous day's temperature.

### Table: `Weather`

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |

- `id` is the unique identifier for each record.
- Each `recordDate` is unique (no duplicates).
- The table stores temperature data for specific dates.



 Objective

Return the `id`s of all records where the temperature is higher than the previous day.



 Sample Input

| id | recordDate | temperature |
|----|------------|-------------|
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |



 Expected Output

| id |
|----|
| 2  |
| 4  |

 Explanation:

- `2015-01-02`: 25 > 10 â†’ higher than previous day 
- `2015-01-03`: 20 < 25 
- `2015-01-04`: 30 > 20
