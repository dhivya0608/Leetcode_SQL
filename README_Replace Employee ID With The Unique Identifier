 SQL Query: Match Employees with Unique ID

This project contains an SQL solution for joining two tables: `Employees` and `EmployeeUNI`. The goal is to list all employees and their corresponding `unique_id`. If an employee does not have a `unique_id`, we return `NULL`.

Employees

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |

- `id` is the primary key for this table.

EmployeeUNI

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| id          | int  |
| unique_id   | int  |

 `(id, unique_id)` is the primary key (composite).

 Problem Statement

Write an SQL query to show the `unique_id` of each user. If a user does not have a `unique_id`, return `NULL`.
