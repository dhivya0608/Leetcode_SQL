 Customers Without Transactions

This SQL project identifies customers who visited a mall but did not make any transactions. The goal is to count how many such visits occurred for each customer.



 Problem Statement

Given two tables:

 1. Visits

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| visit_id    | int  |
| customer_id | int  |

- `visit_id` is the primary key.
- This table contains a record of each customer’s visit to the mall.

 2. Transactions

| Column Name    | Type |
|----------------|------|
| transaction_id | int  |
| visit_id       | int  |
| amount         | int  |

- `transaction_id` is the primary key.
- This table contains transactions made during visits.

Objective

Write an SQL query to find:
- `customer_id`
- `count_no_trans` — the number of visits without any transactions

Return the result in any order.
