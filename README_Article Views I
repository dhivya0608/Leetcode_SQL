Authors Who Viewed Their Own Articles

This SQL query solves a LeetCode problem where we are given a `Views` table containing data about which users viewed which articles.

Problem Statement

Each row in the `Views` table shows an article ID, the author who wrote it, the viewer who viewed it, and the date it was viewed.
We are asked to find all authors who have viewed at least one of their own articles(i.e., where `author_id = viewer_id`).

 Table 

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| article_id  | int  |
| author_id   | int  |
| viewer_id   | int  |
| view_date   | date |

 Note: No primary key. The table may contain duplicate rows.
