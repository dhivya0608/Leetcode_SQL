 Invalid Tweets

This SQL solution filters out tweets that are invalid based on their content length. A tweet is considered invalid if the content length is strictly greater than 15 characters.

 Problem Statement

Given a `Tweets` table with each tweet's ID and content, return the `tweet_id` of tweets that have content longer than 15 characters.


Tweets

| Column Name | Type     |
|-------------|----------|
| tweet_id    | int (PK) |
| content     | varchar  |

- `tweet_id` is the primary key.
- `content` includes alphanumeric characters, `'!'`, and spaces only.
