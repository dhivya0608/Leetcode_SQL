Factory Machine Process Time Analysis

 Problem Description

This project analyzes activity logs from a factory website to compute the average processing time for each machine. Each machine runs multiple processes, and for each process, we are provided with a `start` and an `end` timestamp.

The goal is to calculate the **average time each machine takes to complete a process**, rounded to 3 decimal places.

 Table: `Activity`

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                                      |
|---------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| machine_id    | int     | ID of the machine                                |
| process_id    | int     | ID of the process on the machine                 |
| activity_type | enum    | Either 'start' or 'end'                          |
| timestamp     | float   | Time in seconds when the activity occurred       |

- Composite Primary Key: `(machine_id, process_id, activity_type)`
- Each `(machine_id, process_id)` pair has exactly one `'start'` and one `'end'`.
