 SQL Query: Product Sales Report

This project contains an SQL solution to generate a sales report by joining the `Sales` and `Product` tables. The goal is to display the `product_name`, `year`, and `price` for each sale.

 Table Schemas

 Product Table

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |

- `product_id` is the primary key

Sales Table

| Column Name | Type  |
|-------------|-------|
| sale_id     | int   |
| product_id  | int   |
| year        | int   |
| quantity    | int   |
| price       | int   |

- `(sale_id, year)` is the composite primary key.
- `product_id` is a foreign key referencing the `Product` table.
- `price` is per unit.

 Problem Statement

Write an SQL query to report the `product_name`, `year`, and `price` for each `sale_id` in the `Sales` table.
